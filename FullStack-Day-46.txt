Object Serialization
==========================
Object Serialization is the process of converting a Python object into a byte stream so it can be stored in a file, sent over a network, or saved in a database.
In Python, serialization is commonly done using the pickle module.

Example:
import pickle

data = {"id": 101, "name": "Nikhil"}

with open("obj.dat", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)

Key Points:
Converts objects into bytes
File opened in binary write (wb) mode
Supports complex objects


Object Deserialization
===========================
Object Deserialization is the process of reconstructing the original Python object from the byte stream.

Example:
import pickle

with open("obj.dat", "rb") as f:
    obj = pickle.load(f)

print(obj)

Key Points:
File opened in binary read (rb) mode
Restores original object state
⚠️ Do not deserialize untrusted data
